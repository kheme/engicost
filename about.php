<h2><strong>About EngiCost</strong></h2>
<p>ENGICOST LDA, registered in <?=date("Y")-8;?> with Direcao National Energia in Mozambique, 
is a powerline contractor that offers professional services including, but not 
limited to... import of electrical materials, electrical contracting, electrical 
construction and consultation, just to mention a few. Our area of specialty are power lines, from LV to 275kV 
and we've got all necessary plant and equipment 
to deliver effectively and to any degree, be it LV, MV or HV projects, small 
scale or large scale. We know that is a bold claim, but we have a list of 
satisfied customers to confirm our claims!</p>
<p>In January 2002 when the company was restructured, a new Managing Director, Natie Verwey (B.Eng Electrical/Electronic, PU for CHE) joined the CEO, Conrad Daffie, to 
formulate a more effective management team. And the effect: new ideas, direction, skills, 
creativity, diversity and innovation was birthed into EngiCost.</p>
<p>Over the years, Engicost LDA has successfully placed offices at several 
locations in Mozambique and South Africa: Matola, Mozambique and Komatipoort 
(South Africa).
Therefore, our workforce here at EngiCost comprises of joint skilled labour from both 
Mozambique and South Africa, as well as very skilled linesman from Zimbabwe. We have 
many years of experience both in South Africa and Mozambique.</p>
<p>EngiCost complies to all local Mozambican and South-African requirements and 
legal parameters.</p>
